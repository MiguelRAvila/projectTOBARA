# ProjectTOBARA

The Only Boolean Algebra Reduction App

## Description

Our system is a Boolean function analyzer tool which main task is to reduce the function in its simplest expression. 
With this information we will create an library that allow to any user consulate the elements of any Boolean function they want to introduce. 


## Process

Our main goal is the analysis of the Boolean functions and the breakdown of their main components: 
-	Get the function 
-	Determinate their variables
-	Determinate their terms
-	Simplify the function

## Objective

Algorithms for reducing Boolean functions. 

## Use cases

##### UC001. Simplest expression

**Description:** Consult if the function is in its simplest expression.

**Sequence**

1. Consult the tool Mini(funciónBool).
2. Receives a Boolean value (True or False).

**Alternative departures:** 1.1 If the user ingress an invalid input the system will return error and the user will have to change it.


##### UC002. Simplify

**Description:** Given a Boolean function, the system returns its simples expression. 

**Sequence**

1. Consult the tool reducc(funciónBool).
2. Receives an array with the simplified function.

**Alternative departures:** 1.1 If the user ingress an invalid character the system will return error and the user will have to change it.
